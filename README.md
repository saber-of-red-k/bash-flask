# bash-flask

Working with bash shell scripts in linux + flask and curl project  

chrome+libre.sh - Chrome+Libreoffice installation  
flask.sh - Flask web-server deployment with a simple app on http://127.0.0.1:5000/flask_test  
curl.sh - creating curl aliases and running them for test  
  
excel_file.png - for the file assigment (not in script, since creating empty .xls file from shell don't work properly, resulting in empty file type)
